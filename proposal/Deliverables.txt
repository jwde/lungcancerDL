Deliverables

Jay and Jason are primarily responsible for the upstream and Alex is primarily responsible for the downstream.

Upstream:
Preliminary Data Exploration
Liver Segmentation Network (Jay):
	LSN Example running (End of Spring Break)
	LSN adapted for LUNA data 3/31
	Complete LSN training pipeline 4/3
U-Net (Jason):
	U-Net Example running (End of Spring Break)
	U-Net adapted for LUNA data 3/31
	Complete U-Net training pipeline 4/3
First Pass comparison U-Net and LSN networks trained on LUNA Data (Quantitative & Qualitative) 4/7

Downstream (Alex):
Kaggle 3d Conv Net training example (End of Spring Break)
MIN for mammogram classification example working (End of Spring Break)
MIN code adapted for Kaggle data 3/31
MIN fine tuned on Kaggle data from mammogram pretraining 4/3

Full Training (All):
Weighted MIN (combining upstream and downstream): 4/7
MIN code adapted to use upstream region proposal: 4/7
Additional training for weighted MINs (LSN and U-Net) 4/12 â€” end

Evaluation:
Produce loss vs epoch graphs on Kaggle data (LSN vs U-Net upstream vs unweighted) 4/21
Produce loss vs epoch graphs on Segmentation networks 4/21
Produce Visualization of segmentation results 4/21
Produce Visualizations of effect of upstream segmentations 4/21

Hard Deadlines:
Final Project Milestone 4/4
Kaggle Submission 4/12 (We might not have had very much time to train at this point, we will submit anyway)
Present 4/27
Write paper (A more detailed plan to come) 5/12
