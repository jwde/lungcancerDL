abstract={In this work, the authors have developed a computer-aided diagnosis system, based on a two-level artificial neural network (ANN) architecture. This was trained, tested, and evaluated specifically on the problem of detecting lung cancer nodules found on digitized chest radiographs. The first ANN performs the detection of suspicious regions in a low-resolution image. The input to the second ANN are the curvature peaks computed for all pixels in each suspicious region. This comes from the fact that small tumors possess and identifiable signature in curvature-peak feature space, where curvature is the local curvature of the image data when viewed as a relief map. The output of this network is thresholded at a chosen level of significance to give a positive detection. Tests are performed using 60 radiographs taken from a routine clinic with 90 real nodules and 288 simulated nodules. The authors employed free-response receiver operating characteristics method with the mean number of false positives (FP's) and the sensitivity as performance indexes to evaluate all the simulation results. The combination of the two networks provide results of 89\%-96\% sensitivity and 5-7 FP's/image, depending on the size of the nodules.},

Early detection of lung nodules is currently the one of the most effective ways to predict and treat lung cancer. As a result, the past decade has seen a lot of focus on computer aided diagnosis (CAD) of lung nodules, whose goal is to efficiently detect, segment lung nodules and classify them as being benign or malignant. Effective detection of such nodules remains a challenge due to their arbitrariness in shape, size and texture. In this paper, we propose to employ 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) to learn highly discriminative features for nodule detection in lieu of hand-engineered ones such as geometric shape or texture. While 3D CNNs are promising tools to model the spatio-temporal statistics of data, they are limited by their need for detailed 3D labels, which can be prohibitively expensive when compared obtaining 2D labels. Existing CAD methods rely on obtaining detailed labels for lung nodules, to train models, which is also unrealistic and time consuming. To alleviate this challenge, we propose a solution wherein the expert needs to provide only a point label, i.e., the central pixel of of the nodule, and its largest expected size. We use unsupervised segmentation to grow out a 3D region, which is used to train the CNN. Using experiments on the SPIE-LUNGx dataset, we show that the network trained using these weak labels can produce reasonably low false positive rates with a high sensitivity, even in the absence of accurate 3D labels.
